# Micro frontend with Qiankun 

## About

This project was inspired from [Qiankun](https://github.com/umijs/qiankun)
It shows the microfrontend implementation using React 18, where `app1` and `app2` are React18 app and main is the entry point.

## Install

Execute `npm i` in all 3 folders.

## Run

```
cd main
npm run start
```

## Note
I had to eject the React18 app to be able to modify the config files.


## Issues
Some issues that I've encountered
- lazy loading is not working as expected
- assets are not loading via entry app
